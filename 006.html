  <h1>Simplifying Expressions with FOIL</h1><br>
  <div class = "lesson">
    In this lesson you will learn the process of symplifying expressions with the FOIL method. FOIL stands for First, Outside, Inside, Last.
    In the examples I'll show you what I mean.

      <br>When you multiply two components you square it. The way to type exponents is by having the carrot sign: shift-6.  For example, to type the exponent 3x<sup>2</sup>, you would write 3x^2.<br>Try to solve this problem:<br>

      <span class="q">
      (2x + 2)( 3x+ 4)
      </span>
      <span class="a">6x^2
      </span>
      = <input type="text" class="answer">
    </div>
    <input type="submit">
  </form>

    <form class="question">
    <div class = answerBox>
      Write some explanation
      <span class="q">
      (1x+3)(1)
      </span>
      <span class="a">
      </span>
      = <input type="text" class="answer">
    </div>
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
  
  <form class="question">
    <div class = answerBox>
      <span class="q">
        (2 + 8) + 8 * 2
      </span>
      = <input type="text" class="answer">
    </div>
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
  
  <form class="question">
    <div class = answerBox>
      <span class="q">
         (9x +5x)(5 + 9)
      </span>
      <span class="a"> 
      = <input type="text" class="answer">
    </div>
    <input type="submit">
  </form>

    Now as you can see this is basically like distribution. First take the outside number of the expression which is also the first number and multiple it by the 2 numbers in the second expression. So for example (5x + 2x)(3x + 5x). It would become 5x * 3x = 15x <sup>2</sup> and 
    5x * 5x =  25x<sup>2</sup>. Then you would multiple the inside number by the 2 numbers from the other expression once again meaning it would be 
    2x * 3x = 6x <sup>2</sup> and 2x * 5x = 10x <sup>2</sup>, then you begin to simply from there.
    15x<sup>2</sup> + 25x <sup>2</sup> + 6x <sup>2</sup> + 10x <sup>2</sup>, Simplified it would equal 56x <sup>2</sup>.
